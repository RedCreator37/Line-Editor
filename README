*** Line Editor README ***

This folder contains the source code for a CLI text editor called
Line Editor.

REQUIREMENTS

 - Working C++ compiler, preferably g++
 - Makefile support
 - Ncurses and its panels library

COMPILING

Use the supplied Makefile to compile the program against required
libraries by executing the 'make' command (or 'make run' if you also
want to run the program after compilation).

BUGS

 - The 'find' command is not working
 - The third line of command window (used for displaying file status)
   does not clean up previous output before writing new one
 - There are some possible memory leaks
