# Line Editor

This folder contains the source code for a CLI text editor called
Line Editor.

## Requirements

 - Working C++ compiler, preferably g++, `make`
 - Ncurses and its panels library
 - Terminal with color support

## Compiling

Use the supplied Makefile to compile the program against required
libraries by running `make` (or `make run` if you also
want to run the program after compilation).

After the compilation is done, you can run the editor with
`./lineedit filename`

## Known bugs

 - There are currently some artificial line size limitations
